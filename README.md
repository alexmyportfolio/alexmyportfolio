ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex. Currently I'm finishing my studies in Computer Science and Business Administration and Management.

  This is my personal github account where I will upload different software engineering projects that I have done.
  The aim of this repository is to show my experience and skills about the tech world.
   
  Do no hesitate to contact me about project initiatives or other relevant and interesting topics!
  
  Best wishes,
  Alex.
