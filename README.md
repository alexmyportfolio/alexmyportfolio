ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex. I'm currently finishing my studies in Computer Science and Business Administration and Management.

This is my personal GitHub account, where I will upload various software engineering projects that I've worked on. The goal of this repository is to showcase my experience and skills in the tech world.

Please, do not hesitate to contact me regarding project initiatives or other relevant and interesting topics!

Best wishes,
Alex
